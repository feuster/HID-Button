- A regular pushbutton of your choice
- Circuit:<br> ![Circuit](./docs/Circuit.png)
- Wiring:<br> ![Wiring](./docs/Wiring.png)

## Manual / Remarks
- It is recommended to usb a programmer to upload the sketch like the USBtinyISP or similiar
- Choose Board and Arduino IDE Settings as shown here (__optional:__ choose different programming or upload method):<br> ![Arduino IDE Settings](./docs/Arduino_IDE_Settings.png)
- Install the _Keyboard_ library via the Arduino IDE library manager:<br> ![Arduino IDE Settings](./docs/Arduino_Keyboard_Library.png)
- Before uploading the INO sketch to the board you must change in [Credentials.h](./Credentials.h) the login credentials USER|PASSWORD pairs to the desired real credentials
- If only a password input is needed leave the according USER value in [Credentials.h](./Credentials.h) empty
- __Optional:__ if a 3rd USER|PASSWORD pair credential is needed the reboot function can be disabled by commenting out the according define in exchange to enable this
